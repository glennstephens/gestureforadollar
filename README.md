# gestureforadollar
This is another C# implementation of the $1 Gesture library. 

It is essentially a line-by-line port based on the $1 Javascript version from http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/dollar.js
The code itself is in progress and the current work is looking at adding in the $N support for multi-line usage, although the $1 support works just fine.

While the demo project is written for iOS, the actual library is a Portable Class Library and should be usable from any system that supports it. 

Feel free to contribute, especially looking at the $N support.
